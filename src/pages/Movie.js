                    Throughout my life I've been to the movie theater countless
                    times. Originally, the only option to buy tickets was in
                    person at the ticket stand, but with the popularity of the
                    internet and mobile phones, purchasing tickets online has
                    enabled all of us to have even more control over our movie
                    theater experience, including selecting our seats. <br />
                    <br /> I've found a lot of these seat selection applications
                    extremely unintuitive and frustrating to use, so I wanted to
                    do a full case study to identify common pain points, and
                    address potential solutions.

                    To begin addressing these pain points, I created 6 digital
                    sketches for each of the main screens that would be
                    necessary: Landing page, movie details, and seat selection.
                    These sketches helped me come up with ideas for flows as
                    well as create a logical informational hierarchy.

                    From our research, we gathered that there were 3 primary
                    pain points that were complicating the flow for users. The
                    first related to filters, In general, the implementation of
                    filters isn’t super clear as to what it does and when it
                    needs to be used. Second, was the issue of
                    traffic/busy-ness, Users care about how busy theaters are,
                    and its taking too many clicks for them to get this
                    information. And lastly, users were left in the dark with
                    theater selection, and in many cases were unable to identify
                    that they even had the option to change theaters. <br />
                    <br />
                    We made a series of changes to address these pain points:

                    Finally, after spending some time finding and establishing a
                    visual style for the application, I created the final high
                    fidelity designs.

                            This case study really helped me solidify the
                            importance of user testing at the low fidelity
                            stage. I got so caught up solving the original pain
                            points that were found that I ended up creating new
                            ones! User testing helped me take a step back and
                            readdress the overall goal of the application and
                            helped to identify many new paints points as well.

                            If I were to continue building out and improving
                            this project, I would do another round of usability
                            testing to ensure that the original paint points
                            were accurately addressed. Once solidified, I would
                            create a site map and design guide to help
                            developers transition my designs into code.
